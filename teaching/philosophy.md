## Teaching Philosophy 
My role as a teacher is to help students move beyond learning isolated facts and
become independent problem solvers able to apply their knowledge in novel ways
to unforeseen issues. In my mental shorthand I think of this as striking a balance between the ‘what’ and the ‘why’.

If I focus only on transferring fundamental facts (the ‘what’), I
may produce students who are adept at 'listing major ways to treat wastewater’
but who lack the ability to diagnose a problem not covered on their flashcards.
Conversely, if I only focus on the bigger picture and principles (the ‘why’),  I
will also do my students a disservice – they may be able to expound at length
about the potential meanings of different chemical concentrations in effluent, but would be at a loss if asked to actually measure those same chemicals.

So, how do I find a balance between the ‘what’ and ‘why’, especially when confronted by a large classroom full of students, each with a personal learning style? 

I believe that the best course of action is for students with complementary
learning styles to work together. My most common approach is to alternate short
lecture periods with small group discussions in which students
apply what they just learned to either solve a concrete problem or evaluate a
specific statement. I often try to end the session by having groups compare
their conclusions in an all-class discussion. 

My major task during these discussions is to circulate between groups and
provide direction so that the various personalities within the group interact in
complementary way. Active learners get to dive into a problem, while reflective
learners get a moment to think. Non-majors get insights from majors, while
majors are reminded of the perspectives held by people outside their discipline. 

There are many benefits to these discussions, but their primary goal is to cause
students to work out the ‘why’. By challenging them in this way, they are forced
to go beyond memorizing a fact and must explore its implications. It’s
particularly enlightening for the students when groups disagree; they often 'get
it' while I help them try to integrate competing viewpoints. 

I favor this approach because I have found that students are engaged when I am
engaged and, as I have learned from other educators observing me in the classroom, I am skilled at creating a discussion environment which is relaxed yet on topic.

Although I’m happy to have found this approach, it was mainly accidental. I am
always trying to improve my teaching and the opportunity for specific, directed
development coupled with professional feedback is one of the reasons I’m enrolled in the [Teaching and Communication Certificate](https://grad.ncsu.edu/professional-development/teaching-support/teaching-programs/)
program. For example, while I’m good at
on-the-fly assessment during discussions, I appreciate the practice it has given
me in designing
effective formal assessments and in interpreting their results.
Further, and reflecting my belief that students learn by doing, it has provided me
with many hours of important in-class experience. 

By continually practicing my own skills, I continue to learn new ways to help
students not only retain individual facts, but learn how to actually use their
knowledge.
